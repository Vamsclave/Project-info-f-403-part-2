!! Factorial algorithm !!

LET Factorial BE
    IN(n):    $ Input the number n

    result = 1:    $ Initialize result as 1

    WHILE {1 < n} REPEAT    $ Continue loop as long as n is not 0
        result = result * n:    $ Multiply result by n
        n = n - 1:    $ Decrease n by 1
    END:

    OUT(result):    $ Output the factorial result
END
